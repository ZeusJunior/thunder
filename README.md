# Thunder Authenticator

A Steam Desktop authenticator heavily inspired by [Vapor-Authenticator](https://github.com/HilliamT/Vapor-Authenticator). I like the connection Vapors name has to Steam, but since my name is Zeus, Thunder fits me better!  

Mostly just wanted to see if I could make a more up to date version of it myself, with some features I thought were lacking there. Vapor unfortunately has breaking bugs and seems abandoned :(

## Development

### Install Dependencies

```
$ cd thunder-authenticator
$ yarn install
```
